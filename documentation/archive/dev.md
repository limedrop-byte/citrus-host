// Agent Update System Architecture

1. Version Control:

✅ Implement version tracking for agents
✅ Store current version in DB
✅ Include version check in agent heartbeat

2. Update Mechanisms:

a) Auto-update pipeline:

❌ GitHub webhook triggers update notification
✅ Agents receive update signal via WebSocket
❌ Graceful shutdown of current tasks
✅ Git pull & restart process
✅ Report back success/failure

b) Manual override:

✅ UI button in backend for forced updates
❌ Version rollback capability
❌ Update scheduling for maintenance windows

3. Health Checks:

❌ Pre-update agent health verification
✅ Post-update status confirmation (reporting git version after update)
❌ Automatic rollback on failure
